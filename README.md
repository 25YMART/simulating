# Implementing Juraj Majerik's rides

I aim to walk through Juraj Majerik's implementation of a ride sharing app. I don't aim to add something new but to learn more about simulations and how they are implmented.

Since i aim to learn more about the simulation engine behind the app and not about the various microservices implemented I will implement this locally to avoid the costs and complexity of deploying to the web.
